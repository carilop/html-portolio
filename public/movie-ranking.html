<h2>Julian</h2>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Out of this world, mind bending and cliff hanging ending to keeep you on edge</p>

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Bit of romcom mixing with great music scores. Some may not like the ending but it's realistic to me and I love it</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The little nerd in me just cannot leave this out of the list</p>
